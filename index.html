        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Samantha Jarquin and I currently attend the University of California, Riverside. For the time being, I am interested in being an interior designer and I have had several opportunities presented in which I have gained experience that has showed me the basics of interior design. I would say that the total work experience that I have is very limited as I have dedicated most of my time in my 19 years to volunteer work and simply gaining experience. Along with the work I have put in while not obtaining a salary, I have had actual work experience as well. Both the experience with a salary and that without, have been a great help in forming my skills and knowledge that can have me ready for any job. I am a hard working person that also likes to learn new skills. In the opportunites that I have had to grow with different experiences in jobs, I have definitely gained important life skills that will help me in reaching my professional goals. One of the most important skills that I have gained from my work experience has been socializing as I was mostly shy before I had any work experience at all and that has definitely changed for the better. Now I am comfortable enough to carry out any conversation with anyone I may encounter.<br><br>

        Being an interior designer is something that I have put plenty of effort into and I still continue to do so on the side of the degree I am working towards. From the floor plans to the type of decor a room needs, I have gained experience in many aspects of this career. Some of the experience that I have comes from helping in the business my dad runs. With him I have been able to learn about the floor plans and how to calculate the right amount of space one actually has to work with. Not only do I gain floor plan experience, but I have learned how to create blueprints and even had opportunities to decorate rooms from start to finish sometimes.<br><br>

        With plenty more practice and taking part in additional courses, my experience will be more advanced and it is definitely something that I will continue to do while still attending university. For the time being, the actual knowledge I have of interior designing is limited but I continue to work on extra projects whenever I get the opportunity. Taking part in any project involving interior design in some way is important to me because it will continue to give the experience I need until I can actually dedicate more time to it.
